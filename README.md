Code to trim and map reads to a reference genome. 

'Original' file is trim_map_reads_from_HCTstrains.py used to obtain read densities for strains that obtained a chromosome thorugh horizontal chromosome transfer. We will adjust this script to use it to map sequencing reads to transposon sequences, map reads of whcih only one of the pair maps to the transposon sequence back to the genome to infer (potentially) novel insertion sites within a clonal line.
